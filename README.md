# Geobiochem-Lab-R-Scripts
R scripts used by members of the Geobiochem Lab at Iowa State University (https://geobiochem.ge-at.iastate.edu).

The Geochemistry & Geobiology Laboratory investigates the geochemical imprint of microbial life on the Earth’s surface environment through geological time by studying modern microbial metabolisms and the behavior of metals and minerals under varying aqueous redox regimes. A major focus of our work is understanding the impact of ferruginous conditions on regulating microbial activity and biogeochemical cycling.

This purpose of this repository is to provide R scripts (and their corresponding excel file as practice when available) to the public in order to duplicate our work. Or, to use our R scripts as a guide to create their own figures or run their own analyses.

Please contact nlambrec@iastate.edu with any questions pertaining to R code on this repository.
