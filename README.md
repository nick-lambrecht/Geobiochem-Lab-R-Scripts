# Geobiochem-Lab-R-Scripts
R scripts used by members of the Geobiochem Lab at Iowa State University (https://geobiochem.ge-at.iastate.edu).

The Geochemistry & Geobiology Laboratory investigates the geochemical imprint of microbial life on the Earthâ€™s surface environment through geological time by studying modern microbial metabolisms and the behavior of metals and minerals under varying aqueous redox regimes. A major focus of our work is understanding the impact of ferruginous conditions on regulating microbial activity and biogeochemical cycling.

The purpose of this repository is to provide R scripts (and their corresponding excel file as practice when available) to the public in order to duplicate our work. Or, to use our R scripts as a guide so other scientists can create their own figures or run their own analyses.

<b>NOTE: R code in this GitHub is specific to the research performed in this lab. Therefore the scripts presented here will most certainly have to be modified to fit the needs of <i>your</i> research and <i>your</i> scientific question(s) trying to be answered.</b>

Please contact nlambrec@iastate.edu with any questions pertaining to R code on this repository.
