# Geobiochem-Lab-R-Scripts
R scripts used by members of the Geobiochem Lab at Iowa State University (https://geobiochem.ge-at.iastate.edu).

The Geochemistry & Geobiology Laboratory investigates the geochemical imprint of microbial life on the Earthâ€™s surface environment through geological time by studying modern microbial metabolisms and the behavior of metals and minerals under varying aqueous redox regimes. A major focus of our work is understanding the impact of ferruginous conditions on regulating microbial activity and biogeochemical cycling.

This purpose of this repository is to provide R scripts (and their corresponding excel file as practice when available) to the public in order to duplicate our work. Or, to use our R scripts as a guide to create their own figures or run their own analyses.

<b>NOTE:</b> R code in this GitHub is specific to the research performed in this lab. Therefore, the code is meant for a jumping-off point. In other words, the scripts presented here will most certainly have to be modified to fit the needs of your research and your scientific question(s) trying to be answered.

Please contact nlambrec@iastate.edu with any questions pertaining to R code on this repository.
